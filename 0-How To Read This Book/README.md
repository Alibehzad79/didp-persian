# How to Read This Book

This book contains the descriptions of 22 classic design patterns formulated by the “Gang of Four” (or simply GoF) in 1994.

Each chapter explores a particular pattern. Therefore, you can read from cover to cover or by picking the patterns you’re interested in.

Many patterns are related, so you can easily jump from topic to topic using numerous anchors. The end of each chapter has a list of links between the current pattern and others. If you see the name of a pattern that you haven’t seen yet, just keep reading—this item will appear in one of the next chapters.

Design patterns are universal. Therefore, all code samples in this book are written in pseudocode that doesn’t constrain the material to a particular programming language.

Prior to studying patterns, you can refresh your memory by going over the [key terms of object-oriented programming](../1-Intoduction%20To%20OOP/README.md). That chapter also explains the basics of UML diagrams, which is useful because the book has tons of them. Of course, if you already know all of that, you can proceed to [learning patterns](../2-Introduction%20To%20Design%20Patterns/README.md ) right away.
