# How to Read This Book

This book con­tains the descrip­tions of 22 clas­sic design pat­terns for­mu­lat­ed by the “Gang of Four” (or sim­ply GoF) in 1994.

Each chap­ter explores a par­tic­u­lar pat­tern. There­fore, you can read from cover to cover or by pick­ing the pat­terns you’re inter­est­ed in.

Many pat­terns are relat­ed, so you can eas­i­ly jump from topic to topic using numer­ous anchors. The end of each chap­ter has a list of links between the cur­rent pat­tern and oth­ers. If you see the name of a pat­tern that you haven’t seen yet, just keep read­ing—this item will appear in one of the next chapters.

Design pat­terns are uni­ver­sal. There­fore, all code sam­ples in this book are writ­ten in pseudocode that doesn’t con­strain the mate­r­i­al to a par­tic­u­lar pro­gram­ming language.

Prior to study­ing pat­terns, you can refresh your mem­o­ry by going over the [key terms of object-ori­ent­ed pro­gram­ming](../1-Intoduction%20To%20OOP/README.md). That chap­ter also explains the basics of UML dia­grams, which is use­ful because the book has tons of them. Of course, if you already know all of that, you can pro­ceed to [learn­ing pat­terns](../2-Introduction%20To%20Design%20Patterns/README.md ) right away.
