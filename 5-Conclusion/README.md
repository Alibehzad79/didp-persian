# Conclusion

### Congrats! You have reached the end of the book!

However, there are many other patterns in the world. I hope
that the book will become your starting point for learning pat-
terns and developing superhero program design abilities.

Here are a couple of ideas that will help you decide what to
do next.


- Don’t forget that you also have <a href="https://refactoring.guru/home">**access to an archive**</a> of
downloadable code samples in different programming
languages.

- Read Joshua Kerievsky’s <a href="https://refactoring.guru/ref-to-patterns-book">**“Refactoring To Patterns”**.</a>

- Know nothing about refactoring? <a href = "https://refactoring.guru/refactoring"> **I have a course for you** </a>.

- Print out these <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/cheatsheets">**patterns cheat sheets**</a> and put them somewhere where you’ll be able to see them all the time.

- <a href="https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/feedback">**Leave feedback**</a> on this book. I’ll be very excited to learn
your opinion, even a highly critical one :blush:
